Getting Started
===============

The documentation of enviPath-python assumes some prior knowledge of python. To facilitate access to both novice and expert
users of python, it is presented in two modules, specifically User and Developers Guide.

To start using enviPath-python, please follow the steps described on :ref:`installation`. Afterwards, feel free to explore
the :ref:`objects <objects>` that are used on enviPath. If you want to have a more detailed explanation on how those
objects work in practice, we invite you to read the tutorials available on **User Guide** on the navigation bar. For more
in depth, technical knowledge feel free to explore the :ref:`Developers Guide <package documentation>`.
