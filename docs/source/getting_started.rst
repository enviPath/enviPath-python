Getting Started
===============

The documentation of enviPath-python assumes some prior knowledge of python. However. this documentation has been
divided in 2 modules, Users and Developers Guide, to facilitate the access to both python new comers and experts.

To start using enviPath-python, please follow the steps describe on :ref:`installation`. Afterwards, feel free to explore
the :ref:`objects <objects>` that are used on enviPath. If you want to have a more detailed explanation on how those
objects work in practice, we invite you to check the tutorials available on **User Guide** on the navigation bar. For a more
